# gulp-sass-starter

## Description

A simple starter kit builded with Gulp, SASS, and js/sass lint for better coding

#### Start by running `git clone https://github.com/brianeto/gulp-sass-starter.git`

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have installed [gulp-cli](https://gulpjs.com/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) if you like to install your develop dependencies faster.
1. on *root* folder run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
1. Run `gulp`.
1. Hack the matrix.

## Purpose

This project is trying to give you a quick starter pack for your next static page focused on good FrontEnd practices without taking away the simplicity.\
The following libraries have been curated to get the best from *npm*

## Develop Tools

* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
* ES6 thanks to [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [browser-sync](https://browsersync.io/)
* [imagemin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-imagemin)
* [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint)
* [jshint](http://jshint.com/)
* Run pre-commits for linting with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)

## Project Workflow

All the development files are located in `src/` folder, please do not modify  any *css* or *js* from the *dist* folder, it will be overwritten.

> When committing, a wild pre-commit will spawn and will check all your *js*, *sass* code quality, so you may need to install *jshint* client `npm install -g jshint`.

## TODO'S

* Add modular html
* Add grid system
* Include best FrontEnd code practices via examples

If there is something else you think it would be nice to have submit an issue or a PR if you'd like to contribute :)
